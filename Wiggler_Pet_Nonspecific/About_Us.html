Wiggler.pet was made by a bunch of dedicated nerds who for some godforsaken reason thought it'd be fun to Speedrun, do Math and build Calculators in their free time.
As a result, we have a vast amount of experience in Running, Building and Calculating optimal Sets and Builds.
We're just a bit sad about the Limitations of the usual mediums, such as Google Docs or Imgur.
We're very annoyed with the amount of misinformation and rumours about how skills work et cetera, so we decided to sit down and create this as a resource for people to refer to.
We intend to deliver sources, make our combined knowledge easily accessible and understandable, and help you become the Hunter you never knew you could be.
