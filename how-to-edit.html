      <h2>How to edit (for dummies)(you)</h2>

      You want to import a guide? Poor soul. <br>
      Anyway, here's how:
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      Get guide. Got guide? hooray!<br>
      For readability, i strongly recommend downloading VS-Code (<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>).<br>
      Opening HTML files in it will highlight code, making it much more readable.<br>
      <img src="Sitewide_Images/vssample.GIF" width="60%"><br>
      this is what this very website looks in it!<br>
      (it's a gif so the compression is weird, dont mind that)<br>
      Most of your work from here will be Copy-Pasting. The general Structure of Weapon-related guides is done, you just need to paste the words in the labelled spots and make sure the Images you want to use have the <b>EXACT NAME</b> as found within the html. <br>
      If the image reference says "swaxe1" for example, name it exactly that. Don't get fancy with capitalization, as this whole thing is extremely case sensitive. Don't add spaces either.<br>
      Example of how that's supposed to look:<br>
      <img src="Sitewide_Images/vssample2.GIF" width="60%"><br><br>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      You've successfully copypasted your entire guide? Awesome! Save it as .html file, open your Browser and open that file to see if you've done it successfully and everything works as intended. If it does not, you either deleted something you weren't supposed to or added some < or > somewhere.<br>
      Your best bet is to not use the < and > signs at all. <br>
      For Weaponspecific guides, you'll also want to add the controls of the combos you talked about. This is a little bit finnicky, but you can find the copy-paste string at the top of the page.<br>

      Copy these lines as needed. Note that those are <u>Switch Controller Inputs</u>, if you are unsure, you can load the page in your browser and have it "translate" it for you, like so: <br>
